# Coin-Flip-Streaks
We write a program to find out how often a streak of six heads or a streak of six tails comes up in a randomly generated list of heads and tails.

# Character-Picture-Grid
Use a loop in a loop in order to print grid[0][0], then grid[1][0], then grid[2][0], and so on, up to grid[8][0].
This will finish the first row, so then print a newline. 
Then your program should print grid[0][1], then grid[1][1], then grid[2][1], and so on. The last thing your program will print is grid[8][5].

Also, remember to pass the end keyword argument to print() if you donâ€™t want a newline printed automatically after each print() call.
